            </div>
            <div class="exp">
                <p>By using Arduino UNO and RFID tags, designed a scanner to find the lost personal things like watch ,
                    wallet ,
                    mobile phones . RFID will recognize the things within some specific range of distance.</p>

                <h1>BMS USING DIGITAL TWIN TECHNOLOGY</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="exp">
                <p>A battery management system is designed using the digital twin technology. Battery parameters like
                    voltage,
                    current and temperature were taken from real time battery model and analysed by using kalman filter
                    and
                    predicted the SOC and SOH. Finally the battery parameters were interfaced and twinned by using
                    digital
                    twin
                    technology.</p>
